      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Theater&lt;/em&gt; has been my favourite band for a long time. These progressive metal/rock greats have time and time again pushed the progressive genre further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:artist:2aaLAng2L2aWD2FClzwiep&amp;view=coverart&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly for me, &lt;em&gt;Systematic Chaos&lt;/em&gt;
was, subjectively, their last good album. It seemed that Mike Portnoy, the band&amp;rsquo;s drummer and leader, realised that the material was not up to the usual standard on their next album, Black Clouds and Silver Linings, and thus decided to take a break, and that meant a split from the band as the rest of the members did not want to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3aalbum%3a5ORyMl3oua4PPIWXZVN8kz&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;80&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &amp;lt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been three albums since Systematic Chaos, and while each album has their gems, nothing has ever come close to &lt;em&gt;Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Scenes From A Memory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3aalbum%3a4INFVEhhhnLiqNR4MVPaX8&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;80&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3aalbum%3a1QZi8laY96nhaeGSklvN4D&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;80&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astonishing&lt;/em&gt; promised to be Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s greatest work to date, with 35 songs covering the story of a dystopian future where there is no artistic creativity. I wanted with all my heart, for this album to be another Scenes From a Memory, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that the songs aren&amp;rsquo;t good, but I feel that too much emphasis has been placed on the story rather than the music, which was what Dream Theater excelled at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:6SRlWxC7lMPu2qlwOMslrk&amp;view=coverart&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, for people who do not like heavier songs, do check out &lt;em&gt;When Your Time Has Come&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Answer&lt;/em&gt; and for those who do like heavier songs, do try out the entire album, from start to end, without shuffling. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a majestic rock opera, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the Dream Theater I was waiting years for. Who knows, this might just be your cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a7h40Wjln6yCdwpRjm92wim&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;80&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>The Critic Awakens</title>
      <link>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/12/22/the-critic-awakens/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/12/22/the-critic-awakens/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;🚨 SPOILER ALERT 🚨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start this off by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not a movie critic. I caught The Force Awakens the day it came out, even though I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not a huge fan. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched all the movies twice, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the model of the Millennium Falcon, or the name of Anakin&amp;rsquo;s owner back on Tatooine. I&amp;rsquo;m someone who enjoys the first three movies, plot wise, as I grew up on it, and cannot imagine not knowing Obi-Wan when he was younger or Anakin before he became a rage monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I believe JJ Abrams was under a great amount of fan pressure while directing the movie, and he did very well. The Force Awakens was a good movie, although I wonder if Abrams relied a bit too heavily on the fan favorite characters from the previous movies. Darth Vader&amp;rsquo;s mask did not seem to add much to the movie. The flying scene with the X fighters destroying the &amp;lsquo;death star&amp;rsquo; seemed all too familiar. And of course the Death Star v2.0 itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only gripe with the movie was the casting of Kylo Ren. I did not feel the power from him. I know that this partly was because Kylo Ren hasn&amp;rsquo;t truly fallen, but Kylo&amp;rsquo;s voice and actions did not seem intimidating. Even Darth Maul, the Sith Lord that many people did not like, had more character. I hope the next few movies work on Kylo Ren a bit more, and shape him to be a worthy successor of Darth Vader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had to air my feelings about those few things but the movie itself was great, and had everything I had hoped for (maybe more lightsaber action would be cool :))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun catching the movie if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, but then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have read this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
I have recently been contacted by a friend who informed me that I was looking at this wrongly. Kylo Ren isn&amp;rsquo;t a Dark Force practioner, or at least not yet. He&amp;rsquo;s more of a Dark Force fan, without real training. If we look at the above in this light, we can see why Kylo Ren appears ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also, from my personal reflection, I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s because of balance reasons. There is no strong practioner of the light side of the force and therefore as the force has to have balance, there cannot be too strong a force in the dark side.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>Workstation</title>
      <link>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/12/02/workstation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my first &amp;lsquo;gaming&amp;rsquo; equipment back in 2007. It was a Razer Copperhead. I got it at a super discounted rate that even my Mom approved of. It was a thing of beauty, with the green logo pulsating and the curved edges hinting at the amount of effort the designers put in to make this marvel come to life. Fast forward a couple of years, and many Razer products later, I got myself a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate Battlefield 4 edition. What a mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first experience with a mechanical keyboard. The Razer Blackwidow Ultimate came with Cherry MX Blue switches, and boy was it loud. I loved pounding away at the keys and listening to the loud feedback from the keys hitting the bottom of the board, which to be honest, isn&amp;rsquo;t the correct way to to be using the switches. Who cares about the correct way though, as long as it feels good :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 8 years, and I was using an Apple Wireless keyboard with my MacBook Pro, which is connected to a Dell U2312HM monitor, with my old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.razerzone.com/sg-en/store/razer-deathadder-classic&#34;&gt;Razer DeathAdder&lt;/a&gt;, but I knew something was missing when typing. I do a decent amount of typing when I code, so I felt that it was fair for me to think about looking for a mechanical keyboard, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a noisy one as I would want to bring this keyboard out on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chanced upon a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Noppoo-Mechanical-backlighting-Red-rimmed-backlight/dp/B00K14UN1Q&#34;&gt;Nappoo Lolita&lt;/a&gt; (I know, I know), and for S$60, including shipping, found it a steal. The keyboard does not look very good, and the keycaps do not fit my Mac&amp;rsquo;s function keys as well as modifier keys. After barely a week of using the keyboard, the &amp;lsquo;E&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; keys started fading. Probably because I kept opening Xcode as it was always crashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to splurge on a set of new keycaps, and spend over a week designing this new set of keys. I found a link to someone who designed his own set of keycaps for his Mac, but I decided to make some modifications to fit my work style. I also decided to take the liberty to change the typeface to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(2014_typeface&#34;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;), Apple&amp;rsquo;s new typeface for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to take picture when the final product is done, but for now, these are the designs. Do let me know what you think about the design/color scheme in the comments. Oh and do check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wasdkeyboards.com&#34;&gt;WASDKeyboards.com&lt;/a&gt;. Their customization options are pretty good, and I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things about the CODE keyboard too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music</title>
      <link>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/09/18/music/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2015 22:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/09/18/music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me, knows that I am an Apple fanboy. Naturally, when Apple Music launched back in June, I immediately terminated my Spotify premium subscription that I had been using for slightly over 4 months. Apple Music’s promise of tight integration with iOS and with the huge plethora of songs available, I was ready to make the switch. I was excited to finally listen to Taylor Swift, even though I’m not a huge fan, but the fact that I hadn’t heard it on Spotify enticed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Music&amp;rsquo;s onboarding was something that was talked about as being an interesting and new approach to a selection screen. Was it good from a UX point of view? I would say no. It took forever to go through the genres, and the genres were already little as it was. There was no metal, no subgenres of anything, and somehow, K-pop, M-pop and other asian related music kept popping up. I mentioned that I liked K-pop but loved Rock, but Apple insisted on recommend me dozens of K-pop bands. I get that I am in Singapore, but that doesn’t mean I just like Asian music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Music&amp;rsquo;s feedback mechanism was also not to my taste. I didn’t like the fact that I had to tell Apple what music I liked with the heart buttons. I have been an iTunes Match subscriber for years and they should have known what music I own, but no, I had to tell Apple exactly what songs I liked. I’m sure that Apple was tracking my plays, and therefore tried to guess the songs I liked even though I had not favourited them. In either case, the heart button was, to me, utterly useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats 1. I can’t entirely blame this on Apple, as allegedly MDA was blocking them from broadcasting. Someone&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:80a30196a224b6de08ea1ecb0250d3a5:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:80a30196a224b6de08ea1ecb0250d3a5:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; contacted MDA, and apparently Apple was the one who didn’t contact them. We cannot and should not trust this random forum comment, but in either case, the fact is, Beats 1 isn’t in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripe with Apple Music is their playlist recommendations. They are horrible. Horrible. Maybe this is because I didn’t favourite every single song, but I did favourite a significant amount. The ‘Recommend Less Like This’ button in iTunes did jack shit. Finally after 3 months, I decided that Apple Music just wasn’t ready yet, at least for me. I then decided to go back to Spotify and within 10 minutes, and 2.5 songs later, I knew I made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s Discover Weekly worked. It just worked. I wasn’t forced to ‘heart’ songs that I liked, or kick songs out that I didn’t like. It just simply worked. Playlists were awesome. There were so context sensitive. Burning the midnight oil? No problem, here’s a mix to keep you going. Lazy sunday afternoon?  Here’s a mix to keep you relaxed. I had no idea how much I missed my friends feed as well. If I had wanted to keep my music to myself and not discover new songs, I would just buy albums off iTunes and listen to them offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, Spotify isn’t perfect, there are many songs that aren’t on Spotify, and I hope they are working out reasonable deals with artistes. There’s a reason Taylor Swift chose to go with Apple Music and not Spotify. Spotify’s UI also has room for improvement. I don’t like that my playlists are so cluttered. It makes me think twice about adding playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Spotify after going on a break for three months for a variety of reasons, and I’m really sad that Apple Music failed for me, but Apple is going to work very hard to bring us Spotify users over.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gaming</title>
      <link>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/07/28/gaming/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dota2.com/international/overview/&#34;&gt;The International 5&lt;/a&gt; is upon us now, and while thousands gather at the Key Arena in Seattle, most Dota players are stuck at home, glued to their screens and just watching teams of 5 battle it out for millions. The prize pool now stands at $18 million (and rising), surpassing prize pools of major sporting tournaments like the Super Bowl and NBA finals. Why then is eSports still being looked down on as just something nerdy teenagers play because they don’t have other things to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2&#34;&gt;Dota&lt;/a&gt; player myself, I can only offer my opinion on the matter from an Action RTS standpoint. This might sound pretty cliche, but Dota to me, is more than just clicking a mouse quickly. From the subtle mechanics, to the mind games, to the synergy with your teammates, and of course, reaction times, make this game more than just a game. Even with thousands of hours played, Dota still offers something new every time you boot a new game out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dota has a very steep learning curve, and it never seems to plateau out, which makes for a very exciting game. People who have just a couple of hundred of hours under the belt, are able to best people who have spent 3000 hours in game. It is an interesting game where you have to be thinking constantly and always outplay your opponent. In that regard, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55fBpL1IFvU&#34;&gt;Dota is very similar to chess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about eSports is also the sheer number of people who watch competitive gamers play. Tickets for The International 5, hosted in Seattle’s Key Arena, sold out within minutes, with people coming from all over the world just to watch their favourite team battle it out for the title of being the best team in the world. All this hoohah for a game that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZYMI1zB9s&#34;&gt;free to play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world in general is recognising eSports now. With Amazon paying $1 Billion to grab &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitch.tv&#34;&gt;Twitch.tv&lt;/a&gt; from under Google’s nose, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ycombinator.com/instant-esports-yc-s15-is-espn-for-competitive-gaming&#34;&gt;YC&lt;/a&gt;’s funding of an eSports startup, eSports is getting bigger. Perhaps one day, we gamers will be able to shed the negative image that associated with gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/372835_154528731324940_863073820_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Typical Gamer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Post</title>
      <link>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/07/27/first-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2015 19:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.nikhil.sh/blog/2015/07/27/first-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to make a blog for sometime, in order to just get back to writing, like I used to do when I was younger. This would also serve as a project for me, as I am not too familiar with working with the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with Jekyll, for a bit, when I was making some changes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://rebel.tools&#34; title=&#34;Rebel Tools&#34;&gt;Rebel Tools&lt;/a&gt;, and it was pretty fun so I did consider using Jekyll for this blog. However, I chanced upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34; title=&#34;Hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, which is a static HTML generator in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Hugo as it is fast (way faster than Jekyll), and it seems cool to try out a new technology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x&#34; title=&#34;hyde-x&#34;&gt;Hyde-X&lt;/a&gt;, an enhanced port of the Jekyll &lt;em&gt;”Hyde”&lt;/em&gt; theme, as it’s simple and looks clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty simple to set this blog up. I don’t think that this steps are in the correct order, but it worked :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new GitHub repo, and switch the default branch to gh-pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the config.toml file in order to edit content that will be generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then you just need to run &lt;code&gt;hugo --theme=hyde-x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cd into the public folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m message&lt;/code&gt; to commit locally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; to push to github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to set up a custom domain, there are different steps to take if you were to set up as a project site versus as your main site. Do read up on GitHub for help with that. As this is a project site, I went to my domain registrar, added a CNAME record that pointed to &lt;code&gt;nikhilsh.github.io&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; as the host. I then went over to the folder named static and added a CNAME file there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s basically it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
